                <h4>March, 2018 - September, 2020</h4>
                <p>Science On Wheels is a 40 year old outreach initiative that brings informal STEM education across the Pacific Northwest. As the manager of the program, I grew the initiative so that it was serving more than 120,000 participants annually across 4 states. I led the drive to increase access to STEM education in the state by increasing the percent of delivery to students from low-income communities from 44% to 51% within two years. With my team of supervisors, coordinators, and educators, we collaborated across departments to manage an annual budget of over $500,000 and increased student delivery by 15%. We worked to refine and improve the curriculum to match NGSS standards. We also sought to grow the program with new curriculum, applying for grants and corporate fundraising to launch a $750,000+ new computer science outreach initiative for Washington students. This was in collaboration with Amazon, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, and the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction for Washington State.</p>
